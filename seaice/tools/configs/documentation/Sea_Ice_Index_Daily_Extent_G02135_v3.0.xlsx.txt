Sea Ice Extent Daily
National Snow and Ice Data Center
http://nsidc.org

The Excel workbook contains daily sea ice extent from 1979 to present, in
millions of square kilometers. The eight spreadsheets present single-day extent
values and calculated 5-day trailing average extent values, 5-day trailing
average anomaly, and 5-day trailing average daily change in extent for the
Northern (NH) and Southern (SH) Hemispheres. Blank cells indicate missing
data. Anomalies are compared with the 1981 to 2010 average for that date.

Data are from the NSIDC Sea Ice Index (http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index),
using data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) series of
passive microwave remote sensing instruments. The Sea Ice Index is based on the
data sets, Near-Real-time DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS Daily Polar Gridded Sea Ice
Concentrations (http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0081), and the NASA-produced Sea Ice
Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I Passive Microwave Data
(http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051).
