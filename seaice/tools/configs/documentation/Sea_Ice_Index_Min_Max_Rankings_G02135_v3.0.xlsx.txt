Sea Ice Min Max Rankings
National Snow and Ice Data Center
http://nsidc.org

The Excel workbook contains daily and 5-day trailing average minimum and maximum
sea ice extent values and rankings, 1978 to present, in millions of square
kilometers, for the Northern (NH) and Southern (SH) Hemispheres. The twelve
spreadsheets provide the lowest and highest recorded extent values and dates for
each month and year. For daily rankings, the lowest and highest extent values to
date for the current year are given. 1978 is excluded from the annual rankings
due to incomplete data.

Data are from the NSIDC Sea Ice Index (http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index),
using data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) series of
passive microwave remote sensing instruments. The Sea Ice Index is based on the
data sets, Near-Real-time DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS Daily Polar Gridded Sea Ice
Concentrations (http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0081), and the NASA-produced Sea Ice
Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I Passive Microwave Data
(http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051).
