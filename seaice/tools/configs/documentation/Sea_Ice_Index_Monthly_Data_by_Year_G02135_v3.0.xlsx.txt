Sea Ice Monthly By Year
National Snow and Ice Data Center
http://nsidc.org

The Excel workbook contains four spreadsheets with monthly average sea ice
extent and area, plus weighted average monthly extent and area for each year,
from 1979 to the most recent month, for both the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and
the Southern Hemisphere (SH), in millions of square kilometers.

Data are from the NSIDC Sea Ice Index (http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index),
using data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) series of
passive microwave remote sensing instruments. The Sea Ice Index is based on the
data sets, Near-Real-time DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS Daily Polar Gridded Sea Ice
Concentrations (http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0081), and the NASA-produced Sea Ice
Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I Passive Microwave Data
(http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051).

For more information, see the Sea Ice Index user guide (http://nsidc.org/data/g02135).
