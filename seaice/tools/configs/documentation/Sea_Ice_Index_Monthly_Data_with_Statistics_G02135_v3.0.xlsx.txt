Monthly Sea Ice Index
National Snow and Ice Data Center
http://nsidc.org

The Excel workbook organizes monthly average sea ice extent and area data, in
millions of square kilometers, from 1979 to present by hemisphere and month. The
spreadsheets include extent trends per decade and per year, for each month;
extent anomalies, compared with 1981 to 2010 monthly averages; and extent
rankings from lowest to highest year for each month.

Data are from the NSIDC Sea Ice Index (http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index),
using data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) series of
passive microwave remote sensing instruments. The Sea Ice Index is based on the
data sets, Near-Real-time DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS Daily Polar Gridded Sea Ice
Concentrations (http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0081), and the NASA-produced Sea Ice
Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I Passive Microwave Data
(http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051).
